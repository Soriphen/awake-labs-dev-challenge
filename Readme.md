Two different visualizations linked together, one is a donut chart and the other a line graph. They represent information that tells of the person's anxiety level and heart rate along with the time they both were recorded. The colour of the graph and pie chart is supposed to change to represent the anxiety state, but hasn't been implemented yet.

## To-Dos

- Label does not show the correct date in accordance to the anxiety level. Perhaps due to how the scaling was done. Find another way to abstract the data to exactly show the correct date with anxiety level.

- Link the statistics screen with the measure screen in that the data from the statistics screen will update the display of donut chart in real time.

- Have colour of graphs change based on anxiety state once measure and stat screens are linked.

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```
